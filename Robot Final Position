A robot can move in the four directions N, S, E and W.
- N represents that the robot moves one position towards North.
- S represents that the robot moves one position towards South.
- E represents that the robot moves one position towards East.
- W represents that the robot moves one position towards West.
The robot moves based on the given set of instructions S starting from the position (X, Y). The
program must accept the values of X, Y and a string representing the instructions given to the robot as
the input. The program must print the coordinates of the final position of the robot as the output.

Boundary Condition(s):
-100 <= X, Y <= 100
1 <= Length of S <= 1000

Input Format:
The first line contains X and Y separated by a space.
The second line contains S.

Output Format:
The first line contains the coordinates of the final position of the robot.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
1 2
NNENNWWWS

Output:
-1 5

Explanation:
The initial position of the robot is (1, 2).
N -> (1, 3)
N -> (1, 4)
E -> (2, 4)
N -> (2, 5)
N -> (2, 6)
W -> (1, 6)
W -> (0, 6)
W -> (-1, 6)
S -> (-1, 5)
The final position of the robot is (-1, 5).

Hence the output is
-1 5






Code :

import java.util.*;
public class Hello {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		int x=sc.nextInt();
		int y=sc.nextInt();
		String str=sc.next();
		int n=str.length();
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
		{
		    char c=str.charAt(i);
		    if(c=='N')
		        y++;
		    else if(c=='S')
		        y--;
		    else if(c=='E')
		        x++;
		    else if(c=='W')
		        x--;
		}
		System.out.print(x+" "+y);

	}
}
