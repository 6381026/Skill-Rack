The program must accept two string values S1 and S2 as the input. The string S2 contains only the
characters C, A and D. The program must modify the string S1 based on the characters present in the
string S2.
1) Copy (C) - Copy all the characters in the string S1.
2) Append (A) - Append the characters which are copied last time.
3) Delete (D) - Delete the last character in the string S1 if at least two characters are present.
Finally, the program must print the modified string S1 as the output.
Note: The first two characters of S2 are always C and A.

Boundary Condition(s):
1 <= Length of S1 <= 100
2 <= Length of S2 <= 100

Input Format:
The first line contains S1.
The second line contains S2.

Output Format:
The first line contains the modified string S1.

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
skill
CAACAADDA

Output:
skillskillskillskillskillskillskillskillskiskillskillskill

Explanation:
S1 = skill, S2 = CAACAADDA
The 1st character is C. skill is copied.
The 2nd
character is A. S1 -> skillskill.
The 3rd
character is A. S1 -> skillskillskill.
The 4th
character is C. skillskillskill is copied.
The 5th
character is A. S1 -> skillskillskillskillskillskill.
The 6th
character is A. S1 -> skillskillskillskillskillskillskillskillskill.
The 7th
character is D. S1 -> skillskillskillskillskillskillskillskillskil.
The 8th
character is D. S1 -> skillskillskillskillskillskillskillskillski.
The 9th
character is A. S1 -> skillskillskillskillskillskillskillskillskiskillskillskill.
Hence the modified string S1 is printed as the output.








Code : 

import java.util.*;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		String str1=sc.next();
		String str=sc.next();
		String str2="";

		{
		    char c=str.charAt(i);
		    if(c=='C')
		    {
		        str2=str1;
		    }
		    if(c=='A')
		    {
		        str1=str1+str2;
		    }
		    if(c=='D')
		    {
		        int n=str1.length();
		        if(n>=2)
		        {
		            str1=str1.substring(0,n-1);
		        }
		    }
		}
		System.out.println(str1);
